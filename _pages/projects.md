## OSSEC

[OSSEC](https://www.ossec.net){:target="_blank"} is an open HIDS system that was originally created by Daniel Cid. I got started with the OSSEC Project back when I was working for Trend Micro, which owned the project at the time but wanted to promote it in the open source community. To that end I organized the original series of OSSEC Conferences.  I continue to contribute the OSSEC Server virtual appliances. You can find the [OSSEC code on Github](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids){:target="_blank"}.
