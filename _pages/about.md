>*The best number is 73. You're probably wondering why.  73 is the 21st prime number, its mirror, 37, is the 12th and __its__ mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, 7 and 3. ... In binary 73 is a palindrome, 1001001, which backwards is 1001001.*

Welcome to my website which is the companion to my code contributions on [Github](https://github.com/vichargrave){:target="_blank"}. 

I’m a software engineer and system integrator with over 15 years of experience developing a broad range of security solutions including user/entity behavioral analytics, threat management, and content filtering. I'm also a contributor to the [Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/){:target="_blank"} with their [Top Threats Working Group](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/working-groups/top-threats/#_overview){:target="_blank"} helping them out with security research and reporting.

When I’m not slaving away over a hot keyboard – yes, I do have a life outside technology – I like spending time with my family, cooking, and attending the performing arts – theater, concerts, and movies. My family and I are ardent cat lovers and volunteer with feline rescue organizations fostering cats for future adoption.

## My Blogging History

I got started with blogging at Trend Micro back in 2011 when I wrote a blog on what to do [when your Facebook account is stolen](https://blog.trendmicro.com/what-to-do-when-your-facebook-account-is-stolen/){:target="_blank"} for Trend Micro's internal facing employee social network. The blog was inspired by advice I gave to one of my son's high school teachers when that very thing happened to him. The folks at Trend Micro's Simply Security website liked the piece enough to publish it on their site. A few blogs later they invited me to join the team as one of their regular bloggers. Shortly thereafter, I started contributing code on Github and writing associated blogs for my own personal website which ultimately became this site, [vichargrave.github.io](https://vichargrave.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

Over the years I have written a considerable amount of software project documentation including: design specifications, functional requirements, engineering support training materials and software test set up tutorials. Many years ago I taught a course on Unix Network Programming for UC Berkeley Extension. Writing to explain how things work and are put together has always been a passion of mine.

## Cloud Security Alliance

One of my outside projects is working with the Cloud Security Alliance Top Threats Working Group. We are a group of security analysts, devops, and software development folks who research and write publications about security threats to cloud computing infrastructures.  Our most recent publication is [Top Threats to Cloud Computing - The Egregious 11](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/top-threats-to-cloud-computing-egregious-eleven){:target="_blank"}.  I wrote the section on **insider threats**.

## Feral Cat Rehabilitation

My family and I are very much into cats. We have 4 of our own. We also work with [bay area a4a](http://www.bayareaa4a.org"){:target="_blank"} to foster and help socialize cats that are rescued from the streets. Our goal is to help them feel comfortable being around people and eventually adopted by families that can give these beautiful animals the loving homes they deserve.

## Helping You Figure Stuff Out

I get a kick out of writing blogs to help people understand programming and share points of view on technology and other topics. I hope you find the information on this site interesting and useful.

## A Look Back in Computer History

![](/assets/images/5mb_hard_drive_1956.png){: .align-left} This picture shows some movers pushing an IBM 5 Mb hard drive (yes, that's right 5 **megabytes**) up a ramp in the **really** early days of computers. We've come a long haven't we?

At any rate, many thanks for visiting my website. I hope you find my code projects useful.
