Although Eclipse is commonly used for Java web service programming, it can be challenging to configure and use for testing. Luckily Eclipse is not the only IDE game in town.

NetBeans provides a rich environment for developing Java web services with Jersey – the reference implementation of JAX-RS RESTful web services. This article will explain how to create a simple RESTful service and test it with the Apache Tomcat Server from the NetBeans IDE.

## Install NetBeans and Tomcat

### NetBeans

If you don't have it already, download the J2EE versions of [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads/){:target="_blank"}, which includes GlassFish and Tomcat web servers. I'll use Tomcat in this blog.

1. Open the install then when you get to the *Installation Type* screen, click on the **Customize** button.
2. Select the *Apache Tomcat* package and deselect the *GlassFish Server* package.x2
3. Click **Install** to finish.

### Configure Tomcat

Now we need to configure Tomcat to be able to run and deploy web services. To run web services we need a Tomcat user with `manager-script` privileges. The easiest way to do that is let NetBeans do that for us by deleting the Tomcat server when NetBEans is installed, then adding it back in (bizarre as that may seem).

1. Run NetBeans.
2. When NetBeans comes up, Right click on the **Servers > Apache Tomcat or TomEE** in the **Services** tab.
3. Select the **Apache Tomcat or TomEE** server.
4. Click on the **Remove Server** button.
5. Click on the **Add Server..** button. I told you this is bizarre.
6. Select **Apache Tomcat or TomEE** from the list of servers in the **Choose Server** box.
7. Set the **server Name** to `Apache Tomcat`.
7. Click on **Next**.
8. In the **Add Server Instance** panel, click on **Browse** to find your Tomcat server directory. For the macOS, that is */Applications/NetBeans/apache-tomcat-8.0.27*. Your version of Tomcat and the location maybe different in your case.
9. Select the Tomcat directory and click on **Open**.
10. For both **Username** and **Password** enter `tomcat` to make things simple. For production systems you'll want a better password than that.
11. Set the **Server Port** to `8080` for this example. Like the **Username** and **Password** you can set to whatever you like in the ong run.
12. Make sure the **Create user if it does not exist** box is checked.
13. Click the **Finish** button.
14. Back in the **Servers** panel click the **Close** button.
15. Open up  *$CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml* file. `$CATALINA_HOME` is the directory where you installed Tomcat.
16. Add `manager-gui` to the list of roles for the `tomcat` user.

### Test NetBeans-Tomcat Integration

It's a good idea to test whether Tomcat can now be started within NetBeans.

1. Right click **Servers > Apache Tomcat > Start** in the NetBeans **Services** tab.
2. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080){:target="_blank"} in a browser. That action should open the main Apache Tomcat screen.
3. Click on the **Manager App** button
4. Then enter `tomcat` for the user name and password. That action should open the **Tomcat Web Application Manager** screen, an example of which is shown below:
   ![](/assets/images/Netbeans-Tomcat-Web-Application-Manager.png){: .align-center}

Note that the **Deploy** section of this screen provides the tools we need to deploy our web service to Tomcat.

## Create RESTful Web Services

### Create a Web Application Project

After configuring the development environment, you first need to build a base web application to which you will add a RESTful services class and methods later.

1. Select **File > Open > New Project…**
2. Select the **Java Web** category and Web Application project, then click Next.
   ![](/assets/images/NetBeans-New-Project.png){: .align-center}
3. Enter the project name as *getsomerest*.
4. Set the directory location of the project, then click **Next**. This action sets the top level REST path variable in the *context.xml* file.
   ![](/assets/images/NetBeans-New-Web-Application.png){: .align-center}
5. In the **Server and Settings** screen, select  **Apache Tomcat** in the **Server** field, then click **Next**.
   ![](/assets/images/NetBeans-Server-and-Settings.png){: .align-center}
6. We will not add any additional application frameworks, so click **Finish** in the **Frameworks** screen (not shown).

You now have a simple web application that will load the index.html page. To run the application, click on the green triangle under the NetBeans menu bar, select **Run > Project** from the menu bar or press **F6**.

### GET Service Handler

Now that we have a basic web application, we will add a RESTful service that responds to an HTTP GET request.

1. Right click on **getsomerest** in the **Projects** tab.
2. Select **New…** then select **RESTful Web Services from Patterns…**
3. Select the **Simple Root Resource** in the **Select Pattern** screen.
4. Then click **Next**.
   ![](/assets/images/NetBeans-New-RESTful-Web-Service.png){: .align-center}
5. In the **Specify Resource** screen set the name of the Java package that will contain your service class. The name can be anything, but it is usually a domain name in reverse order. In this example we’ll use com.example.
6. Set the service **Path** to `service` and the service **Class Name** to `ServiceResource`.
7. Set the MIME type for the GET service to `text/html` for the simple GET service then click on **Finish**.
   ![](/assets/images/NetBeans-Specify-Resource-Classes.png){: .align-center}
8. You will now see a section in your project called **RESTful Web Services**. If you open this section you can see the service class with GET and PUT handler methods that have been created.  Replace the contents of the `getHtml()` with the `return` statement as shown below.  Note that the content type of the return string is specified by the `@Produces(“text/html”)` Jersey annotation.

{% highlight java %}
package com.example;

import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import javax.ws.rs.core.UriInfo;
import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;
import javax.ws.rs.Consumes;
import javax.ws.rs.PUT;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;

@Path("service")
public class ServiceResource {

    @Context
    private UriInfo context;

    public ServiceResource() {
    }

    @GET
    @Produces("text/html")
    public String getHtml() {
        return "<h1>Get some REST!</h1>";
    }

    @PUT
    @Consumes("text/html")
    public void putHtml(String content) {
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Next we need to set the path to the web service so it will be automatically invoked when we test it with the default browser.

1. In the **Projects** tab right click on the **getsomerest** project then select **Properties**.
2. In the **Categories** section select **Run**.
3. When we test the web service the URL to the GET service will be `http://localhost:8080/getsomerest/webresources/service`. Recall that the `getsomerest` part of the URL is defined in the path attribute in the *context.xml* file which you can find in the configuration files of the project. The `webresources` part of the path is set in the `@javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath("webresources")` annotation in the *ApplicationConfig.java* file that NetBeans created. The `service` part is defined by the `@Path` annotation in the **ServiceResource.java** file. Enter `/webresources/service` in the **Relative URL** field then click **OK**.
    ![](/assets/images/NetBeans-Project-Properties.png){: .align-center}

### POST Service Handler

Most web services have a POST handler so let’s add one now.  The handler will accept urlencoded text from a REST client which is specified with the @Consumes`(“application/x-www-form-urlencoded”)` Jersey annotation.  In this case the POST handler will simply return the decoded plain text to the client which is specified with the `@Produces(“text/plain”)` Jersey annotation.

Add the following `import` statement to the list of imports.

{% highlight java %}
import javax.ws.rs.POST;
{% endhighlight %}

Add the following code to the `ServiceResource` class.

{% highlight java %}
@POST
@Consumes("application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
@Produces("text/plain")
public String postHandler(String content) {
    return content;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `@Consumes` annotation specifies that the POST handler accepts requests containing URL encoded data. The `Content-Type` of the POST request much match the `@Consumes` type or else the POST handler will not get called. The `@Produces` annotation specifies that the POST handler will return ordinary text.

If your server is still running from previous testing, NetBeans will automatically deploy the service in your test environment and restart Tomcat.  Otherwise run the project again. You can test the web service by sending it a file from your system with the curl command as follows.

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl http://localhost:8080/getsomerest/webresources/service --data "Hello World!"
{% endhighlight %}

The POST handler should return `Hello World!`.

### Web Service Deployment

Now that you have a working RESTful web service with GET and POST handlers, you’ll want to deploy the service to your target Tomcat server. NetBeans packages all the web service code into a WAR package.  In the case of this project the package will be called GetSomeRest.war. You can deploy this package to the target Tomcat server as follows:

1. Open the Tomcat main page in your browser.  Use the **Username**, **Password**, and **Server Port** you entered when you set up the Tomcat server. The host will be `localhost` since the testing is done with the syste where NetBeasn is installed.
2. Click on the **Manager** button using the credentials you set in *tomcat-users.xml* earlier.
3. Scroll down to the WAR file to deploy.
4. Click on the **Choose** file button.
5. Navigate to your *NetBeansProjects/GetSomeRest/dist* directory and select *GetSomeRest.war*.
6. Click on **Deploy**. In the *Path* column under **Applications** you should see `/getromerest`.
7. Run the curl command from the previous section with the host/IP and port for your target Tomcat to make sure the service is working.

## Jersey Web Service Annotations

Jersey provides a set of Java annotations that can be used to define the web service structure. So far we have already used these annotations in the example GET service:

- `@Path` – Defines the URL relative path to the given resource. We saw in the previous section that the complete URL to our service was defined by fields in the *context.xml* and *web.xml* files plus the `@Path` field. You can change the relative path of any service by modifying these three fields. For example if you wanted to simplify the GET service URL to be `http://localhost:8080/GetSomeRest/service` you would set the `url-pattern` field in *web.xml* to `/*`.
- `@Context` – Defines parameters that can be extracted from the request.
- `@GET` – Identifes the method in the service class that will handle GET requests.
- `@Produces` – Specifies the MIME type of the response that is returned to the client.
- `@Consumes` – Specifies the content type that the service will accept as input.

Some other important annotations that you’ll want to know about include:

- `@PUT` – Identifies the method that will handle PUT requests.
- `@DELETE` – Identifies the method that will handle DELETE requests.
- `@Consumes` – Specifies the MIME type that the method immediately following the annotation will accept from the client. It is possible to define multiple MIME types that will each be handled by a separate method. The GET service example does not have any arguments so the `@Consumes` annotation was not needed. If we wanted to add a string parameter to the GET service the code for the `getHTML()` method would look something like this:

{% highlight java %}
@GET
@Consumes("text/plain")
@Produces("text/html")
public String getHtml(String message) {
    return "<h1>The browser sent this message "+message+"</h1>";
}
{% endhighlight %}

- `@QueryParam` – Denotes a field that will be extracted from the URL in a GET request after the `?` character. Here is an example taken from the Jersey documentation website. For a URL request of this form: `http://<server>:8080/<path>/smooth?step=<value>&min-m=<value>&...`. The handler method would look like this:

{% highlight java %}
@Path("smooth")
@GET
public Response smooth(
@DefaultValue("2") @QueryParam("step") int step,
@DefaultValue("true") @QueryParam("min-m") boolean hasMin,
@DefaultValue("true") @QueryParam("max-m") boolean hasMax,
@DefaultValue("true") @QueryParam("last-m") boolean hasLast,           
@DefaultValue("blue") @QueryParam("min-color") ColorParam minColor,
@DefaultValue("green") @QueryParam("max-color") ColorParam maxColor,
@DefaultValue("red") @QueryParam("last-color") ColorParam lastColor
) { ... }
{% endhighlight %}

- `@DefaultValue` – Denotes the value that will be used to fill a variable in a `@QueryParam` list that is missing.
- `@PathParam` – Denotes a field that will be extracted from a field in the URL path. Here is an example taken from the Jersey documentation website:

{% highlight java %}
@GET
@Path("/images/{image}")
@Produces("image/*")
public Response getImage(@PathParam("image") String image) {
  if (!isSafeToOpenFile(image)) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot open the image file.");
  }

  File f = new File(image);

  if (!f.exists()) {
    throw new WebApplicationException(404);
  }

  String mt = new MimetypesFileTypeMap().getContentType(f);
  return Response.ok(f, mt).build();
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Test RESTful Web Services

You can get the source code for the GetSomeRest project from GitHub – [https://github.com/vichargrave/getsomerest](https://github.com/vichargrave/getsomerest){:target="_blank"}. The master branch contains the project described in this blog. Open the project in Netbeans and run it with Tomcat according to the directions in this blog.

## Additional Information

The intent of this blog is to get you started with RESTful web services in NetBeans. To keep things simple I’ve left out some important aspects of web service development not the least of which includes processing POST and PUT request bodies.
